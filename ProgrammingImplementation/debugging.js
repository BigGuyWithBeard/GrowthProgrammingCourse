black box testing:
 - testing driven
 - goal:  ???????? 
 - example techniques - equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, decision table testing, state transition testing, use case testing, exploratory testing, error guessing, pairwise testing, random testing, mutation testing, fuzz testing, performance testing, load testing, stress testing, security testing, usability testing, accessibility testing, compatibility testing

 white box testing
 just looking at the code - data structures, logic etc
 - test based on code strucutre, code paths and logic.
 - goal: improve code quality and ensure all paths covered
 - examples: statement coverage, branch coverage, path coverage, condition coverage, multiple condition coverage, loop coverage, data flow testing, control flow testing, mutation testing, code review, static analysis, code complexity analysis.

alpha testing
by internal staff
controlled environment, simulated environment

beta test
released to real users
// real world environment
